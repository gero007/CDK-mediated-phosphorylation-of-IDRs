# PSP Search Result Legend	 
# COLUMN HEADER	DESCRIPTION
# PROTEIN	Primary name in PhosphoSitePlusÂ® (PSP)
# GENE	Unique ID (UID) assigned to a gene by the HUGO Nomenclature Committee and adapted by HUPO for the cognate protein.
# ORGANISM	The species from which either the kinase and/or substrate proteins have been derived
# ACC_ID	Primary accession ID in PSP
# MW_(DA)	Molecular weight in Daltons.
# MOD_RSD	The location within the protein sequence of the amino acid residue that is posttranslationally modified (modsite).
# SITE_+/-7_AA	The modsite plus flanking sequence (+/- 7 rsds.). The modsite, as well as other residues within the flanking sequence that are known to be posttranslationally modified, are displayed in lower-case letters.
# SITE_GRP_ID	Unique identifier of the modification site and its homologous sites in all proteoforms and species
# DOMAIN	The Pfam residue in which the modsite is located.
# METHOD	The experimental method in which kinase-substrate relationships were reported. Vivo = in vivo: determined from reactions within living cells, cell cultures or organisms. Vitro = in vitro: determined from reactions outside of living cellular structures.
# LTP_LIT	The number of literature records using low-throughput (LTP) experimental techniques in which the modsite has been reported. LTP results may be more reliable than MS2 results.
# MS2_LIT	The number of literature records using tandem mass spectrometry (MS2) experimental techniques in which the modsite has been observed.
# MS2_CST	The number of curation sets (CS) derived from MS2 experiments performed at Cell Signaling Technology (CST) in which the modsite has been observed.
# CST_CAT#	The catalog number(s) of CST antibodies specific for the associated modsite.

#there's overlapping between the targets. I create 13 differents DF and I will merge them
